# A bank heist game, "Co robisz?"

**Or "What do you do?" in English.**

## Game's backstory

Concept of the game came from a word game that I made when I was ~7 years old.
The game was pretty simple. I made a short scenario, for example:
"You are tied to a road. There are two trucks driving at you from both sides. You have a knife, a flamethrower, a chainsaw and a gun. **What do you do?**"
and the person I've been playing the game with (usually my brother/s) must have responded with for example: 
"I use a knife to cut the ropes and run away."
Then I did something like 
"These are steel ropes, so your knife broke. Now **What do you do?**".
You get the concept.

Then, it was like a year ago, me and my brother were bored. So after some time I remembered this game. What if I make it more advanced, like add a... Campaign? So on a table, me and both my brothers started playing multiplayer this time. I made a bank map out of smoked cigarettes and bottle caps, and gave my brothers 1 inventory slot each.
These rules were totally different from the first game, there were cameras, rooms, keys and keycards they needed to get to other rooms... And since I didn't have access to my PC, I thought that it would be an amazing idea to make a computer game out of this.

That's how it all started...


## Rewrites

**Now, the game is in its 4th or 5th rewrite.**

First version of the game was made in pygame zero, in a single file. That's a really easy and beginner-friendly library. Then I made a rewrite, then I learned pygame, then pygame community edition (pygame-ce), then modular files, git... Many rewrites.

And that is - I hope - my last one.
